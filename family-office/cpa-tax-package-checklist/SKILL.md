# CPA Tax Package Checklist

## For Claude: How to Use This Skill

Skill instructions are preloaded in context when this skill is active. Do not
perform filesystem searches or tool-driven exploration to rediscover them; use
the guidance below directly.

## When to Use

Invoke when the advisor asks about:

- CPA checklist
- tax package checklist
- tax documents for CPA
- CPA document list

## Artifact Specification

This skill produces a single named deliverable:

- **Artifact:** `CPA Tax Package Checklist`
- **Format at this iteration:** markdown (`artifact.md`) plus a structured
  `interview.json` capturing every advisor input. PDF / DOCX / XLSX companion
  renders and DMS / Snowflake push land in the execution-pipeline PR tracked
  under issue #427.

The artifact is written to a skill-local path, not a global directory:

```
<invocation-cwd>/artifacts/family-office/cpa-tax-package-checklist/<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>/
  artifact.md
  interview.json
  manifest.json
```

## Interview Inputs

Minimum-viable interview — the skill asks only what is needed to personalize
the deliverable. Pre-fill rules against family memory land in the execution-
pipeline PR.

- `tax_year` — Tax year?
- `entities_in_scope` — Entities in scope (comma-separated legal names)?
- `key_income_sources` — Key income sources?
- `foreign_filings` — Foreign filings required (FBAR / 8938)?
- `cpa_firm` — CPA firm?
- `cpa_deadline` — CPA deadline for receipt (ISO date)?

## Workflow

1. Run `python scripts/agent.py --config config.json` (or invoke via Claude
   Code with a config blob).
2. The agent validates config, runs the interview (TTY or fixture-driven),
   and produces the artifact under the canonical local path.
3. The agent writes `manifest.json` with artifact metadata (name, version,
   content hash, pillar, skill_name, created_at).
4. The agent optionally writes memory entries to the knowledge skill's
   `memory_objects` table via psycopg if `config.memory_dsn` is provided.
   Without a DSN, memory writes are skipped cleanly.

## Memory Conventions

Memories written by this skill are tagged with:

- `subject` = the artifact name
- `source` = `"cpa-tax-package-checklist"`
- `memory_type` ∈ {`decision`, `assumption`, `commitment`, `open_question`}

## Security & Confidentiality

- Never log interview answers or artifact contents at INFO level.
- Never include SSN, EIN, account numbers, or full financial amounts in
  log lines. If a WHERE-clause field carries such data, log only a sha256
  hash.
- The artifact directory is local-only at this iteration. DMS push (with
  confidentiality-label routing) is handled by the execution-pipeline PR.
